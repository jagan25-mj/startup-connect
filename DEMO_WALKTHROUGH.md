## Talking Track (Non-Technical Version)

```
"Hi everyone! Today I want to show you CollabHub.

We've all seen the problem: 
- It takes months for founders to find the right talent
- Talented people can't find startups aligned with their values
- Investors need a better way to vet opportunities

CollabHub solves this through three key features:

First, AI-powered matching. When talent joins, our system instantly finds 
the best-fit startups. Not just by keywords, but by deep skill alignment.

Second, structured feedback. When investors review startups, they provide 
clear, actionable feedback. No more "love it, talk later."

Third, real-time collaboration. Everyone stays in sync with built-in 
messaging and notifications.

Let me walk you through a complete workflow...

[Start with Part 1]

As you can see, what used to take months now takes minutes. The AI does 
the heavy lifting, and founders, talent, and investors make better decisions.

Any questions?"
```

## Post-Demo Conversation Starters

1. **Product**: "Would you use this for your next hire / next investor round?"
2. **Market**: "How big is the talent matching market in your region?"
3. **Business**: "What's your go-to-market strategy?"
4. **Scale**: "How many founders and talents are using this?"
5. **Differentiation**: "What makes this better than LinkedIn, AngelList, etc.?"
